This Task View contains information about controlling and documenting computational environments in R. The base version of R does not provide features to manage different version of R or collections of packages easily, so a number of approaches and packages exist to simplify computational environments for the sake of development, testing, bug-fixing, and reproducibility. The [ReproducibleResearch Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/view=ReproducibleResearch) provides further discussion of packages around scientific reproducibility.

If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements for this Task View, go to GitHub and [submit an issue](https://github.com/o2r-project/ctv-computational-environments/issues), or make some changes and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/o2r-project/ctv-computational-environments/pulls). If you can't contribute on GitHub,

send Daniel an email (daniel.nuest at uni-muenster dot de)

. If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that package.

## Tools for working with Containers

**Docker**

The following packages integrate or use Docker:

  - [one](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/one/index.html) is ...
  - [two](https://github.com/) (not on CRAN) is ...
  - [analogsea](https://github.com/sckott/analogsea) is a general purpose client for the Digital Ocean v2 API. In addition, the package includes functions to install various R tools including base R, RStudio server, and more. There's an improving interface to interact with docker on your remote droplets via this package.
